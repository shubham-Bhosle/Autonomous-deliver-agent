# Autonomous-deliver-agent
An autonomous delivery agent for a 2D grid city that navigates static obstacles and dynamic traffic using AI search algorithms like BFS, UCS, A*, hill climbing, and simulated annealing. It supports rational planning with fuel and time limits, dynamic replanning, modular Python design, clear visualization, and CLI testing.
